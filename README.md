1.Rift Valley.
2.North Eastern.
3.Coast.
4.Western.
5.Eastern
6.Nairobi.
7.Central.

Different stakeholders are Key players in the education industry led by Religious Organizations. Also the distribution of these learning is uneven and is dependant on various things such as demand for education and also geographical location. The Population of Kenya is highest
between 0-18 years creating a high demand for ECD,Primary and Secondary education.
