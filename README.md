The project does a comprehensive analysis of school distribution in Kenya based on the 8 Provinces, based on the founders/sponsors and the difference between public and private schools. I used a data set from the Ministry of Education in Kenya. I performed ETL processes and dealt with missing data to enhance data integrity. Evidently, it emerged how different stakeholders have been pivotal in education particularly religious organizations who have played a key role. The study also explores the link between school classification, quality of education, enrollment rates and accessibility of schools. Using Streamlit I was able to create interactive charts to show the distribution.
