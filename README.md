The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the distribution of schools in Kenya, with a particular focus on the role of their founders or sponsors, while distinguishing between public and private institutions. This analysis encompasses all eight provinces in Kenya: Rift Valley, North Eastern, Coast, Western, Eastern, Nairobi, Central, and Nyanza. Within the complex landscape of the education sector, various stakeholders play pivotal roles, with religious organizations taking the lead. The distribution of schools across these provinces is not uniform, and it is influenced by factors such as the demand for education and geographical location. It is worth noting that Kenya's population is predominantly composed of individuals between the ages of 0-18 years, resulting in a substantial demand for Early Childhood Development (ECD), primary, and secondary education. The quality of education is closely linked to the classification of the school as public or private. Typically, private schools are considered more prestigious, thus their enrollment rates are lower compared to public schools.At the tertiary level, the education landscape includes diverse options such as public and private universities, technical training institutes, technology institutes, and national polytechnics. However, these higher learning institutions are relatively scarce due to the high costs associated with establishing and maintaining them, including the need to offer a wide array of courses. As a result, the fees charged by these institutions are considerably high, discouraging many potential students from enrolling. To counteract this, the Kenyan government has made efforts to increase enrollment by encouraging students to take loans through the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB).All visual representations of school distribution across provinces are conveniently accessible through a Streamlit application.

METHODOLOGY:
To conduct this analysis, I utilized a dataset provided by the Ministry of Education in Kenya. The dataset underwent an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to prepare it for analysis. During this process, I addressed missing data by imputing null values with the mode, considering that the data primarily consisted of string values. Duplicates were removed to create a dataset with unique values, enhancing data integrity. In the "Sponsor" column, sponsors with value counts less than 10 were dropped from the dataset as their contribution was deemed minimal, and their numbers were relatively high. Furthermore, feature extraction was employed to encode categorical columns as continuous variables, facilitating a more in-depth analysis of the data.To enhance the visualization of school distribution, I extracted the coordinates from the dataset to create a separate data frame. This allowed for easy iteration through the coordinates, simplifying the process of generating geojson plots illustrating the distribution of schools across the regions.
